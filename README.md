AIR QUALITY INDEX PREDICTION

The objective of this project is to identify the most polluted city based on AQI value and to create a model to predict the quality of air.

The code is written in Python.
Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib,  scikit-learn, Random Forest Classifier.

Reference: [AQI_Formula](https://app.cpcbccr.com â€º AQI -Calculator)

Impact: The insights can be shared with the local government and public health agencies to find optimal solutions for effective air quality management and provide health recommendations.

I have also created an interactive Tableau dashboard to identify the most pollutated city in India.
